<h3 align="center">An educational game for people with down syndrome</h3>

**Concept:**

The Children's Hospital of Philadephia (CHOP) often conducts sleep studies on children with down syndrome. A sleep study entails a measurement of brain waves, blood oxygen levels, heart rate and breathing during sleep, and is vital for these children. However, children with down syndrome often find it difficult to understand the [lengthy procedures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpDz_I6nxn4) required for these studies, and are not always very cooperative. Therefore, CHOP has contracted us (a group of 5 from UPenn) to create an educational game that helps these children understand and cooperate with these lengthy studies.
